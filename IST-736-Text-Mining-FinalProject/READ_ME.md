## Hip Hop Lyrics Analysis
## Project Goals
The objective of this project is to create a new dataset of text data, define a clear or question to be investigated, and relate it to industry examples

## Overview
Our group was interested in the application of text mining at major music streaming platforms, and wondered: Can subgenres of hip hop be detected from the lyrics used in a song? Properties of the hip hop songs, souch as diction, word frequency, and content in theory should create distinct differences between songs that originate in different regions or decades. We sought to investigate this by creating our own data set of hip hop lyrics, and running 3 machine learning models to classify songs by subgenre, and then evaluating for accuracy.
